# Real-Time Weapon Detection in CCTV Videos Using AIML

# Project Overview
This project, developed as part of an Honor Degree at Savitribai Phule Pune University , focuses on real-time weapon detection in CCTV video streams using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML). The system aims to address the inefficiencies of human surveillance by proactively identifying weapons in real-time, enabling faster responses to potential threats. The project leverages deep learning algorithms to detect weapons, classify them, and notify security personnel promptly.

# Problem Statement
Traditional CCTV surveillance relies heavily on human monitoring, which is inefficient, error-prone, and often results in delayed responses to threats. Conventional security systems lack real-time weapon detection capabilities, increasing the risk of harm to individuals and property. This project aims to develop a deep learning-based solution for real-time weapon detection to enhance security monitoring.

# Objectives
1. Develop a deep learning-based weapon detection system using advanced algorithms like YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and Detectron.
2. Ensure precise identification and classification of weapons in CCTV video streams.
3. Achieve minimal latency for immediate threat detection through model optimization.
4. Provide prompt notifications to security personnel for rapid response.
5. Seamlessly integrate the system with existing security infrastructure.
